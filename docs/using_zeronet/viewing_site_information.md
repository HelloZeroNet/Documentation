# Viewing Site Information

It is possible to view the network information of a given site by dragging the "zero icon" you see on the top right corner to the left. This action exposes a side bar containing following information on the current site:

 - Number and approximate location of peers
 - The amount of received and sent data
 - File type and size 
 - A field to define the maximum amount of space you want to reserve on your hard drive to store data for this site
 - The identity you are using on this specific site (which you can change here)
 - Site controls (update, pause and delete)
