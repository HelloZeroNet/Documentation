# Getting Started

ZeroNet allows you to publish static and dynamic websites on a distributed web platform.

In ZeroNet there is no concept of servers. Thus, server-side languages like PHP or Ruby are not needed. Instead, one can create dynamic content using ZeroNet's API (called ZeroFrame), JavaScript (or CoffeeScript) and the SQL database provided to all websites.

## Tutorials

### ZeroChat tutorial

In this tutorial we are going to build a P2P, decentralized, server-less chat site in less then 100 lines of code.

## Useful Information

### ZeroNet Debug mode

ZeroNet comes with a `--debug` flag that will make site development easier.

To run ZeroNet in debug mode use: `python zeronet.py --debug`

If you are using compiled/bundled version of ZeroNet:

* On Windows: `lib\ZeroNet.cmd --debug`
* On Linux: `./ZeroNet.sh --debug`
* On Mac: `./ZeroNet.app/Contents/MacOS/ZeroNet --debug`

#### Debug mode features:

- Automatic CoffeeScript -> JavaScript conversion (All examples used in this documentation and sample sites are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/))
- Debug messages will appear in the console
- Auto reload of some source files (UiRequest, UiWebsocket, FileRequest) on modification to prevent restarting (Requires [PyFilesystem](http://pyfilesystem.org/) on GNU/Linux)
- `http://127.0.0.1:43110/Debug` Traceback and interactive Python console at the last error position (using the wonderful Werkzeug debugger - Requires [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/))
- `http://127.0.0.1:43110/Console` Spawns an interactive Python console (Requires [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/))

### Disable HTTP Browser Caching

In addition to Debug Mode, disabling HTTP Caching in the browser is an essential part of ZeroNet site development. Modern web browsers attempt to cache web content whenever they can. As all ZeroNet sites run in an iframe, web browsers cannot detect when a ZeroNet site's content changes, and thus site changes are often not reflected if HTTP Caching is enabled.

To disable, open your browser's devtools, navigate to the devtools settings and check the option along the lines of 'Disable HTTP Cache (when toolbox is open)'. As the setting suggests, make sure to keep devtools open when testing new changes to your site!

### Extra features (works only for sites that you own)

 - Merged CSS files: All CSS files inside the site folder will be merged into one file called `all.css`. You can choose to include only this file to your site. If you want to keep the other CSS files to make the development easier, you can add them to the ignore key of your `content.json`. This way, they won't be published with your site. (eg: add to your `content.json` `"ignore": "(js|css)/(?!all.(js|css))"` this will ignore all CSS and JS files except `all.js` and `all.css`)
 - Merged JS files: All JS files inside the site folder will be merged into one file called `all.js`. If a CoffeeScript compiler is present (bundled for Windows) it will convert `.coffee` to `.js`.
 - Order in which files are merged into all.css/all.js: Files inside subdirectories of the css/js folder comes first; Files in the css/js folder will be merged according to file name ordering (01_a.css, 02_a.css, etc)
