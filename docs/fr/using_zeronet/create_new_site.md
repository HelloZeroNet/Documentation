# Create new ZeroNet site

## Easy way: Using the web interface

 * Click on **â‹®** > **"Create new, empty site"** menu item on the site [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D).
 * You will be **redirected** to a completely new site that is only modifiable by you!
 * You can find and modify your site's content in **data/[yoursiteaddress]** directory
 * After the modifications open your site, drag the topright "0" button to left, then press **sign** and **publish** buttons on the bottom

## Manual way: Using the command line

### 1. Create site structure

* Shut down ZeroNet if it is running
* Browse to the folder where ZeroNet is installed and run:

```bash
$ zeronet.py siteCreate
...
- Site private key: 23DKQpzxhbVBrAtvLEc2uvk7DZweh4qL3fn3jpM3LgHDczMK2TtYUq
- Site address: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
...
- Site created!
$ zeronet.py
...
```

- This will create the initial files for your site inside ```data/13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2```.

> __Note:__
> Windows users using the bundle version must browse into the ZeroBundle/ZeroNet folder and run `"../Python/python.exe" zeronet.py siteCreate`

### 2. Build/Modify site

* Update the site files located in ```data/[your site address key]``` (eg: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2).
* When your site is ready run:

```bash
$ zeronet.py siteSign 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
- Signing site: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2...
Private key (input hidden):
```

* Enter the private key you got when you created the site. This will sign all files so peers can verify that the site owner is who made the changes.

### 3. Publish site changes

* In order to inform peers about the changes you made you need to run:

```bash
$ zeronet.py sitePublish 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
...
Site:13DNDk..bhC2 Publishing to 3/10 peers...
Site:13DNDk..bhC2 Successfuly published to 3 peers
- Serving files....
```

* That's it! You've successfully signed and published your modifications.
* Your site will be accessible from: ```http://localhost:43110/13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2```
